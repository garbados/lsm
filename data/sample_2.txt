James is sitting in the dark, trying to get as stoned as he can, dick in one hand, then bong in both, then his dick in one and then the bong again, spacing out and thinking about this dress in his closet that he hates, this girl that he’s supposed to love but doesn’t really feel anything about. Thinking, What the fuck is wrong with you, dude. Shit like that. If he were in a French movie maybe he’d put his dick away and go for a late night walk where he would feel feelings, but dude a late night walk in Star City looks like fucking nothing. He’d walk by a bunch of houses either to Wal-Mart or to the highway access road or the desert. And anyway, this is an American film. If it were a Tarantino movie maybe he’d kill everybody. In a David Lynch movie it wouldn’t even be clear what happened next but you would know it was something. But obviously this isn’t a movie and he’s just a stupid clueless pervert stoner with no idea what the fuck is going on in his life. Maybe he should call Nicole. He doesn’t even understand that fight they had. He didn’t want to have sex so now they are having a fight? You were supposed to be allowed to say no to sex. That was what sex positive feminism was about: choice. Isn’t consent important? But maybe he did it wrong, or maybe that’s just for women. Whatever. They’ve had this fight before and it didn’t go anywhere then and he’s sure they’ll have it again. She’ll come over tomorrow night and he’ll be like, I dunno. And she’ll be like, I dunno. And then one of them will apologize and then the other will apologize and they’ll go back to pissing their lives away with shitty Drew Carey movies forever. Eventually he gets stoned enough that he gets off, comes into a sock he’s already worn twice, and is able to go to sleep.
