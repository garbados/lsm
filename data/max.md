Craft your resume like a portfolio

Recently, I received a lovely note from a recruiter via LinkedIn. She wrote:

I get so bored reading LinkedIn pages and yours blew me away. […] I liked your profile because it gave a great description of who you are and what you believe in as a person, not simply a rundown of your job duties and professional experience.

It made my day. I felt affirmed in my convictions to do what you love, and let your works speak for you. Through your acts, I will come to know you better than I would through any mere rundown of how many years you spent in which offices, and what you claim to have done therein.

Based on the recruiter’s feedback, conversations with buddies across HR, and my own experience, here’s how to write a resume that rocks — that is, that works like a portfolio:

Say little; do more

I don’t let descriptions of my work cross 200 characters. A harsher, better metric is 140 characters. Brevity is power: obliterate adjectives, crush adverbs, and squash sentences into their barest parts.

But there’s so much to say, right? Focus on this:

Speak to your beliefs

Your values dictate your trajectory. Why did you do what you did? What did you learn? Ignore your day to day duties except insofar as they describe skills of which you remain proud.

For many years, I cherished a line on my resume about a warehouse job I had taken outside of a college I attended. There, I learned about how to build intra-team camaraderie, how to destroy it through poor management, and ultimately, how not to treat your employees. I spent my days hauling boxes and delivering packages, but that’s not what I treasured about the experience, so that’s not what I wrote about.

Let your works embody you

It doesn’t show up on my LinkedIn, but when people ask for a resume, I either refuse, or give them one wherein the first section is Projects. Each line is a 140-character descriptions with a link to the project in action. I don’t put things in that section unless I can show something for my work.

For developers, link libraries you wrote, websites you built, etc. For marketers, point to your blog(s) and social media channels. For salesfolk, highlight deals you closed and partnerships you built. For designers — well, y’all already use portfolios. Let your works speak for you.

Resumes exemplify why it is so difficult for so many to find work they love. It blows my mind that we still use them, but while we do, let’s make ours great.
